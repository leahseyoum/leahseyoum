### About Me :
:woman_technologist: I am a full stack software from engineer from the San Francisco Bay Area.

I love problem-solving and thrive on the challenge of finding inventive solutions to complex issues. My focus as a software engineer is not only on crafting useful and efficient software but also on creating products that resonate with users and leave a positive impact on their experiences.

Some of my hobbies include reading science fiction, playing tennis, discovering new foods, and spending time with my dog Luna :dog:
